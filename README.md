# Phaxio 10-File API Limit Demonstration

I ran into Phaxio seeming to have an undocumented limit of 10 files that it can accept as part of a multi-part POST with images to be faxed (for example, 11 images representing 11 pages). This code reproduces this finding with the plain-old `curl` utility (i.e., no client library).

## Setup

Get a Phaxio account, and set the following environment variables:

`DESTINATION_FAX_NUMBER` â€” a phone number where you can receive faxes (an easy option is a service like Phaxio or HelloFax), for example `4151112222`

`PHAXIO_API_KEY`

`PHAXIO_API_SECRET`

Then `bash test-phaxio-11-images.sh` and check out your Phaxio dashboard. In my experiments, it should only show a 10-page fax where an 11-page one should exist.
